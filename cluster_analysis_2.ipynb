If your testing the pillow on a hard surface but your bed is soft than that you will probably have to go firmer than what you find immediately comfortable. Once you buy a good pillow once you'll be able to just touch pillows at the store to determine if it's right for you so maybe experiment and buy a handful of really cheap pillows to test the firmness. Test the current pillows you have for firmness as well. Brand isn't so important so go cheap if you want to.

None of that egg crate foam either, not good for a pillow unless u like a broken neck upon waking.
